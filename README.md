## Description

Stockx is a middleman in selling sneakers. The bug on their site accrues for over a year, so I have decided to fix it myself. Listed prices of users without VATID are divided on backend by 1.05, and this change does not reflect on the user side. So when someone list something for 100$, the real price he listed is 95$, and the user has no idea of it to the point he sells the item.

Script reduces time of managing 100 pairs by 85%
